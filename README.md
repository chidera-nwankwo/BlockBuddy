# BlockBuddy
A Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker app

The app will allow users to manually save their owned cryptocurrencies in a convenient list with accurate up-to-date pricing. There will be no direct connection to any cryptocurrency wallets. The app will also allow users to input any transaction they make and will automatically calculate the percent and dollar profit in each coin or profit across their entire portfolio. It will also keep track of and show the user the net cost (how much spent buying their holdings). The app will be an easy to read description of your portfolio making it easy for the user to drop in and check or update their holdings without hassle.
